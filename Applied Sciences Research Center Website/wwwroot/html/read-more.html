                        <p>We're thrilled to announce that we have placed the order for Phase One of Beta with masks
                            being shipped out as early as March 31st!</p>
                        <p>Tune in, <a
                                href="https://youtu.be/61LiEnxs2Ls?utm_source=Klaviyo&amp;utm_medium=campaign&amp;utm_campaign=Founders-Update-30%20%2801JK4ZQ7DK1ZQ64487PDWRVWN5%29&amp;utm_id=01JK4ZQ7DK1ZQ64487PDWRVWN5&amp;utm_term=watch%20the%20video&amp;tw_source=Klaviyo&amp;tw_profile_id=S2BeuU&amp;tw_medium=campaign&amp;_kx=_c2qkrmWYl4gLr1-9g-1oQ.TP37Zp">watch
                                the video</a>, and let us know your thoughts through the Founders Feedback survey.</p>
                        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/61LiEnxs2Ls" frameborder="0"

                        <p>In summary, phase one will focus on the fit, comfort, and durability of the mask. The
                            feedback from phase one will be incorporated into phase two of Beta which will focus on the
                            technology.</p>
                        <p>We'll be reaching out to all Beta customers over the new few weeks to confirm their shipping
                            address, set expectations, and give a much deeper overview of the Beta program.</p>
                        <h3 id="h3-5cb0deb179fc" class="scroll-mt-[80px]">Your Comments, Our Responses âš¡</h3>
                        <p><strong>Have you set a date for mass production?</strong><br>We need to ensure every piece of
                            feedback is incorporated before we lock in a mass production date. Some of the feedback
                            during Beta may require additional tooling or re-certification. We're still expecting a late
                            Q2 ship date and will have more concrete answers in April after we've collected feedback
                            from Beta.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why is Beta launching in two phases?</strong><br>Building BÃ­a is similar to a relay
                            race where there are steps that need to happen in a specific order and we can't ship until
                            all contestants cross their respective finish lines. In our case, the soft-goods needs to be
                            final before we incorporate the hardware as changes to soft goods could mean changes to
                            hardware design, which will likely require recertification.</p>
                        <p><strong>How do I know if I'm part of Beta?</strong><br>Beta was closed April 1st, 2024 and
                            only a select 500 were part of it before then. If you are in Beta, you'll receive an email
                            from us in the next couple of weeks to confirm all your information. We'll be personally
                            reaching out to confirm availability.</p>
                        <p><strong>I'm on the Beta waitlist, when will I know if I'm accepted?</strong><br>If you've
                            been added to the waitlist for Beta we'll be emailing you closer to the end of the March to
                            let you know if you've made it into the program. If you'd like to be part of Beta and
                            haven't already signed up for the waitlist, <a
